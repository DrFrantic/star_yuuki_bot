## Maybe you had seen it !
Yeah! This is the BOT which was the first Chinese LINE Group Security BOT.
Now, it is OpenSource.

## License
This software using Mozilla Public License 2.0.

## Warning
The project was stopped in 2017/06. So the latest stable version is "v6.3.2". Some function of old version maybe will make your LINE account be banned.

## Requires
    python >= 2.6 (Python 3 Not Support)
    thrift >= 0.11.0

### Before v6.5.0:
It was used the edited version of [carpedm20/LINE](https://github.com/carpedm20/LINE) API to run the Application. So you need to make the LINEAPI for it.

### After (Future):
You need the "LINE  Unofficial  API Python Core" only. (Ex:[olsb](https://github.com/star-inc/olsb_cores),  [akad](https://pypi.org/project/akad), [curve](https://pypi.org/project/curve) ...)

## Old Version
Maybe you want the history version of SYB. Click [it](https://github.com/star-inc/star_yuuki_bot/releases/tag/old-versions).
